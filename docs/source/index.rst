**Star Forge Systems**
Welcome to the Force System LITE documentation!
===================================

**Force System LITE** is a simplified Force System meant to be utilized in Star Wars Games
on the Roblox Platform.

It's designed to be a "Plug & Play" style system in which all of the appropriate files are contained
within the package, and need to be moved into place.

The system offers over **15+** unique abilities, as well as passive "background" abilities that do not
need to be activated.

This adds depth to your Star Wars Roleplay game, by offering players the ability to utilize mystical force
abilities against each other.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
