Below is a detailed list of each ability and it's capabilities, as well as strengths and weaknesses.

These abilities can be modified and assigned to all levels, so be sure to read carefully to understand what each one does.



Force Blind
------------
- **Effect Level:** Medium
- **Area Type**: Area
- **Type:** Mental
- **Description** Temporarily obscures (but not completely) the vision of a group of opponents within a certain region. Unlike **Mind Trick**, Blind only darkens the screen. 
This can be used to temporarily disrupt an enemy's ability to pinpoint you in the world.

- **Pros:** Can be used to make a quick escape or change locations quickly.
- **Cons:** A train player may be able to dodge appropriately, rendering the effect useless.
