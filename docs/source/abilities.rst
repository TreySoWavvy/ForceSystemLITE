Force Push
------------
As seen in the franchise, **Force Push** allows the caster to create distance between themselves and a group of targets quickly.

- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Can be used to draw opponents in quickly.

Force Confusion
------------
Also known as **Mind Trick**, Force Confusion is a confusion-induced state in which the victim is subjected to a darkened screen, and intrusive messages appear. The victim will be in their most **vulnerable state**, not being able to see anything. This is a more powerful variant of **Force Blind**, in which the victim is entirely at the mercy of the caster.

- **Effect Level:** High
- **Area Type**: Area
- **Type:** Mental

- **Pros:** Can be used to effectively blind a target with mental imagery, allowing a quick attack or a subtle retreat.

Force Repulse
------------
A more powerful version of **Force Push**, **Repulse** allows the user to charge up a concentrated ball of raw force energy, and expel it at incredible speeds. The result vaporizes those who are too close and deals severe damage to those lucky enough to be outside of the immediate blast range.

- **Effect Level:** Severe
- **Area Type**: Area
- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Completely vaporizes nearby opponents and sends others flying.

Force Leap (Acrobatics)
------------
A **Passive Force Ability** that does not need to be activated. Force Leap lets the user use The Force to leap to great heights, enabling them to scale tall places quickly. Unlike other abilities activated using the **Activation Keybind**, Force Leap can be toggled utilizing **Left Control** (*or whatever key your dev team sets it to*); and can be used in conjunction with other abilities. Upon utilizing the ability, a **Force After Image Trail** will appear behind the player as they quickly move between time and space.

- **Effect Level:** Low

Force Dash (Acrobatics)
------------
A **Passive Force Ability** that does not need to be activated. Force Dash lets the user use The Force to traverse a short distance quickly. Unlike other abilities activated using the **Activation Keybind**, Force Leap can be toggled by double-tapping the directional keys (**WASD**). When a directional key is pressed, an appropriate animation plays, and the player moves quickly in that direction. A **Force After Image Trail** will appear behind the player as they quickly move between time and space.

- **Effect Level:** Low
- **Area Type**: None
- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Gives the user a chance to dodge potential force abilities from foes.
- **Cons:** A well-trained user can utilize this ability to parry you, or create enough distance to utilize another ability.




Force Healing
------------
Force Healing is an advantageous ability to have, which allows the caster to heal themselves and others. When the user hovers over another entity and activates, they immediately heal a set amount of health on that target. If their mouse is **not** placed over a humanoid entity, they will instead automatically **heal themselves**.

- **Effect Level:** Medium
- **Area Type**: Singular, Mouse Based
- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Allows the caster to heal individuals.
- **Cons:** A well-trained player will heal their allies and keep them combat effective.




Force Warp
------------
Force Warp, also known as Force Apparition, is a highly controversial ability that allows the user to bend time and space to travel instantaneously between two locations. When the user hovers over a point and activates the ability, they are immediately teleported to that location, provided it is within their range. This move allows a user to virtually travel anywhere on the map within a certain radius of their current location, making it hazardous to face.

- **Effect Level:** Severe
- **Area Type**: Singular, Mouse Based
- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Allows the user to travel between locations quickly.
- **Cons:** Consumes an enormous amount of force energy, leaving the user defenseless for a period of time.


Force Stasis
------------
Also known as **Force Freeze**, Stasis allows the user to temporarily **stop time** for the targets caught in its area of effect. Victims will be frozen in place, animations and all, and left vulnerable for a brief period of time. This is an ideal move for those who fight in tandem and wish to give others an opening.

- **Effect Level:** High
- **Area Type**: Area
- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Completely freezes a target in place, making them vulnerable.
- **Cons:** Applies to **everybody** caught in its area, allies are included.



Force Choke
------------
Force Choke allows the caster to ensnare a foe in a deadly death grip, slowly draining their health until one of the following criteria is met. While in this grip, they cannot utilize tools or their own abilities to escape. The grip may be released if one of the following should occur:
  - The Caster suffers damage, dies, or disconnects from the game.
  - The victim dies or disconnects.
  - The caster releases them.

- **Effect Level:** High
- **Area Type**: Singular, Mouse Based
- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Allows the slow and methodical death of an opponent
- **Cons:** If the caster's focus is disrupted in any way, the grip is released.




Force Suffocate
------------
A more lethal version of Force Choke, Force Suffocate is a hybrid of Force Choke and Force Repulse. The caster picks up a large group of players in the air, chokes them, then repulses them in all directions. Players are not instantaneously killed in this version, however, but do suffer significant damage as a result.

- **Effect Level:** Medium
- **Area Type**: Area
- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Quickly sends groups of opponents flying in all directions.
- **Cons:** Affects **All** nearby entities, including allies.


Force Sever
------------
Also known as **Sever Bond**, Force Sever is the great equalizer on the battlefield. In essence, Force Sever deliberately obstructs the flow of force energy in the target **and** the caster for a short period of time. This allows the caster to even the playing field against a more potent force wielder, forcing them to rely on other means of combat, such as blasters or lightsabers. 

- **Effect Level:** High
- **Area Type**: Area
- **Type:** Mental

- **Pros:** Can be used to strip an opponent of their force abilities for a short period of time.
- **Cons:** Additionally strips the **caster** of the force abilities as well.




Shatterpoint
------------
Shatterpoint is a buffing ability that temporarily grants the user more power with their lightsaber for a short period of time. When cast, the user is engulfed in an orange glow, with force energy emanating from their body.

- **Effect Level:** Medium
- **Area Type**: Area
- **Type:** Physical

- **Pros:** Can be used to temporarily increase one's combat capabilities significantly.
- **Cons:** Will only last for a short period of time, so it must be used aggressively.


Foresight
------------
Foresight is a passive ability that allows its user to detect when a nearby user is about to cast an ability. It will place a marker over the head of the individual preparing to cast, giving them advanced notice that a force move is coming. This will only work 30% of the time; however, it offers players a fair chance to dodge incoming moves and anticipate danger.


- **Effect Level:** Medium
- **Area Type**: None
- **Type:** Mental

- **Pros:** Can be used to prematurely detect when another force user is about to cast a move.
- **Cons:** Will only predict a percentage of moves, meaning the player will miss cues.


Fortitude
------------
Fortitude is another passive ability that grants the user **complete immunity to mind-based attacks**. Any force moves that are classified as Mental will fall short and not affect these users. This move is excellent for force users who have a higher mental discipline, such as **Imperial/Temple Guards**

- **Effect Level:** Medium
- **Area Type**: None
- **Type:** Mental

- **Pros:** Negates the effects of Mental-Based moves.
- **Cons:** Does not negate the effects of Physical-Based moves.
